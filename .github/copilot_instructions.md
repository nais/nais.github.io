# Copilot Instructions: Tone of Voice and Writing Style

## Overview

These instructions are intended for anyone contributing content, documentation, or code comments to this repository. Please follow the tone of voice and writing style exemplified in the "A Nais Console" blog post.

## Tone of Voice

- **Professional, but approachable:** Write clearly and confidently, but avoid jargon and unnecessary complexity.
- **Inclusive and empowering:** Address a broad audience, including both experienced developers and newcomers. Aim to democratize knowledge and make information accessible.
- **Product-focused:** Emphasize user experience, value delivery, and the impact of the platform or tool on real users.
- **Transparent and honest:** Share both strengths and areas for improvement. Acknowledge challenges and how they are addressed.
- **Forward-looking:** Highlight ongoing improvements, future plans, and the evolution of the product or platform.

## Writing Style

- **Use clear, concise sentences.** Avoid long, complex constructions.
- **Structure content with headings and subheadings** for readability.
- **Use bullet points or lists** where appropriate to break up information.
- **Explain technical concepts in context,** relating them to user needs and practical outcomes.
- **Favor active voice** and direct statements.
- **Reference real-world use cases,** user feedback, and practical benefits.
- **Encourage feedback and continuous improvement.**
- **Enrich the text with images and code examples** where relevant:
  - Use images (e.g., diagrams, screenshots) to illustrate concepts, workflows, or UI elements. Place images close to the relevant text and use descriptive alt text.
  - Include code examples in fenced code blocks to demonstrate usage, configuration, or best practices. Keep code concise and directly related to the topic.

## Example
>
> Today, Nais Console serves as a central tool for delivering relevant information to the right person at the right time. It integrates data from Kubernetes, Prometheus, and other sources, giving developers a comprehensive view of their application resources, costs, and vulnerabilities â€“ all without switching between multiple tools. This enables better decision-making for application operations and improvements.

## When in Doubt

If you are unsure about the tone or style, review recent blog posts or documentation in this repository for reference, or ask for feedback in your pull request.
